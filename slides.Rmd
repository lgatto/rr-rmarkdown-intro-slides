## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of reproducible research and reproducible
  documents.
- Undertand the process by which a source document in compiled into a
  final report.
- Generate a reproducible report in html or pdf from an Rmarkdown
  document using RStudio.

## Reproducible research 

The table below summerises different levels of reproducible research focusing on data and code in
computational projects.

|                    | Same data | Different data |
|--------------------|:---------:|:--------------:|
| **Same code**      |           |       |
| **Different code** |           |       |

Reproducible research refers to research that can be reproduced under
various conditions and by different people.

|--------------------|:---------:|:--------------:|
| **Same code**      |  **Repeat**|       |
| **Different code** |           |       |


**Repeat** my experiment, i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results using the same setup (data, software, ...) in the same lab or on the same computer.

**Reproduce** an experiment (not ones own), i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer, using the same or similar setup.

| **Different code** |  Reproduce | **Replicate** |


**Replicate** an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough) tables/graphs/results in a different set up.

Finally, **re-use** the information/knowledge from one experiment to run a different experiment with the aim to **confirm** results from scratch.

## Five selfish reasons

There are many reasons to work reproducibly, and Markowetz (2015)
nicely summarises 5 good reasons. Importantly, he stressed out that
the first beneficiary of reproducible work are the student/research
that apply these principles:

1. Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster.
2. Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers.
3. Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way.
4. Reproducibility enables continuity of your work.
5. Reproducibility helps to build your reputation.


## `knitr` and `rmarkdown`

- `knitr::knit` converts the `Rmd` into `md` by executing the code
  chunks and replacing the code by its output (text, tables, figures,
  ...).

- The `md` file is then compiled into the desired [output
  format](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html) (typically html
  or pdf) using `pandoc`.
  
- In practice, in R, these two steps are automatically handled in one
  go by `rmarkdown::render()`.


```{r rmarkdownflow, results='asis', fig.cap="The rmarkdown workflow (image from RStudio)", out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/rmarkdownflow.png")
```

## Rmd

An Rmarkdown (Rmd) document is composed of 

- An optional YAML **header**, delimited by `---`. 

- Text in [simple **markdown**
  format](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).

- One or more R **code chunks** delimited by three backticks. Each
  code chunk can be uniquely named and parametrised with a set of code
  chunk [options](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/).


RStudio also supports
[Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html)
documents[^jupyter] that execute individual code chunks independently
and display directly in the source document.


## Additional features

- Caching with `cache = TRUE`.

- Interactive tables with `DT::datatable()`.

- Packages and version with `sessionInfo()`.

- RStudio also supports [Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html) documents that execute individual code chunks independently and display directly in the source document.
